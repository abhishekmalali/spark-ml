# CS 205 Final Project

This is the official repo for the CS205 final prohect *Implementation of Spark Machine learning algorithms* to model categorical data. A detailed documentation can be found at <http://abhishekmalali.github.io/spark-ml/>

## Random Forests

For running the random forest code, create a new folder called data in 

`rForests/`

and unpack the data from the [Forests-UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/covtype.data.gz).
Alternatively, you can use our custom python script via 

	python download_data.py

## Ordinal Regression
For running the ordinal regression code, a small dataset (10K entries) has been supplied. A tutorial documentation is furthermore provided giving an in-depth deviation of the idea and motivation behind ordinal regression.
