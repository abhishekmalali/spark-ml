	\section{Background}
	
	Spark's machine learning library MLlib has vast functionality but unfortunately lacks certain classifiers. Ordinal logistic regression is one of those missing classifiers, and is particularly useful for ordinal dependent variables, such as rating systems and surveys. We propose to design an ordinal logit library built on top of Spark that is optimized to take advantage of Spark's parallelism.  

	
	\section{Objectives - Functionality and Performance}
	To implement the machine learning algorithms in Spark while benchmarking the code against Scikit-learn and MLlib which is the standard Machine learning library for Spark. A part of the project will also focus on fitting the data to the problem in the best possible way while ensuring all standard ML rules are followed.

	\section{Design Overview - Technologies and use of Parallelism}

	\section{Verification}
	Once a data set is determined, we will use the existing ordinal logit libraries in Mort or scikit-learn to establish a baseline. We will evaluate performance as compared against other Spark implementations of ordinal logit found online (if they exist) and against MLlib's linear regression, by treating the ordinal data as continuous.
